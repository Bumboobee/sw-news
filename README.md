## SW-news
The **[SW news](https://bumboobee.github.io/sw-news/)** is the place where you can see the latest **[Mavel](https://www.marvel.com/)** works and get alert for what is coming.

That project has a special place in my heart... This is the **update version** of my **[first web project](https://bumboobee.github.io/sw-news/)**, 
back in november 2021, when i first mett the **[front-end world ‚ù§](https://github.com/Bumboobee?tab=repositories)**

The colors can be a little messy but is for a good reason ‚ò∫, I wanted to keep the layout and the original colors as the original one does ***(probably i never post this version üò∂ - so messy)***.

## About

How i said before, **this project is kind special for me,** so i decided to follow all the web-development steps to get the **[final result.](https://bumboobee.github.io/sw-news/)**

Since the **[prototype on figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iwTpVuhCe5GgBtVYnB2l4W/Primeiro-site?node-id=0%3A1)** ***(where you can see the original one)*** until the clean code on my project! 

## Take a look
