## SW-news
The **[SW news](https://bumboobee.github.io/SW-news/)** is the place to see the latest [Mavel](https://www.marvel.com/) works and get alert for what is coming.

That project has a special place in my heart... This is the **update version** of my **[first web project](https://bumboobee.github.io/SW-news/)**, 
back in november 2021, when i first mett the **[front-end world ❤](https://github.com/Bumboobee?tab=repositories)**

The colors can be a little messy but is for a good reason ☺, I wanted to keep the layout and the original colors as the original one does ***(probably i never post this version 😶 - so messy)***.

## About

How i said before, **this project is kind special for me,** so i decided to follow all the web-development steps to get the **[final result.](https://bumboobee.github.io/SW-news/)**

Since the **[prototype on figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iwTpVuhCe5GgBtVYnB2l4W/Primeiro-site?node-id=0%3A1)** ***(where you can see the original one)*** until the clean code on my project! 

## Take a look
