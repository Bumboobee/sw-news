        <h3>ABOUT THE MOVIE, &nbsp; <strong class="focus">  WHAT CHANGES NOW?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After Peter's identity was exposed by Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) at
          the end of 2019's Spider-Man: Far Away Home, he asks fellow Avenger
          Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to use his magic to help
          him get back his anonymity. Unfortunately, Strange breaks open the
          multiverse and supervillains from alternate realities arrive to hunt
          Peter down, according to the first trailer. That includes Doc Ock,
          played by Alfred Molina, who originated the role of the scientist
          turned villain in 2004's Spider-Man 2 starring Tobey Maguire.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holland told Entertainment Weekly that getting the chance to work with
          Molina was a blast from Spider-Man movie's past. “It was really fun to
          watch him see how technology has advanced,” the Cherry star told the
          publication in October. “When he was making these films, the arms were
          puppets, and when we did it, they're all imaginary and CG. It was
          quite cool to see him relive it, but also relearn it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The trailer for No Way Home hints at possible crossover moments with
          not only the Sam Raimi-directed films, but The Amazing Spider-Man
          franchise starring Andrew Garfield. While Holland is staying mum about
          the details of the film, he told EW that he sees the movie as the end
          of an era. “We were all treating [No Way Home] as the end of a
          franchise, let's say,” he noted. “I think if we were lucky enough to
          dive into these characters again, you'd be seeing a very different
          version. It would no longer be the Homecoming trilogy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Uncharted actor continued, “We would give it some time and try to
          build something different and tonally change the films. Whether that
          happens or not, I don't know. But we were definitely treating [No Way
          Home] like it was coming to an end, and it felt like it.”
